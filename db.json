    "description" : "His name is Max, and his world is fire and blood. Australian filmmaker George Miller had already established the postapocalyptic, predator-or-prey landscape inhabited by ex-cop Max Rockatansky in three previous movies, all starring Mel Gibson; his first sequel, known on these shores as The Road Warrior, had been considered the gold standard for dystopian car-chase extravaganzas. When it came time to revisit Mad Max decades after 1985’s Beyond Thunderdome, Miller decided he’d try to do the film the old-fashioned way, with lots of practical stunts. The director wanted nothing less than to outdo himself. He succeeded.",

He’s a one-man killing machine that people refer to as a mythological boogieman. You do not want to make John Wick angry, in other words. Which is exactly what some Russian mobsters do. Bad move. Cue payback, mayhem and a pile of corpses.",
